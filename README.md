Helping developers give credit where it's rightfully due in an automated fashion!

This plugin builds on the good work done by Christophe Knage on [iOS AcknowledgementGenerator](https://github.com/cvknage/iOS-AcknowledgementGenerator) in the form of a Fastlane plugin, along with adding the ability to strip unwanted markdown from license files.

By the way, Christophe if you're reading this, I owe you a drink should I ever meet you üçª.

## Getting started

### 1.  Gather your license files

Place all of your licenses from your various dependencies in a directory (e.g., a `licenses` folder in your project directory).  Each license file should be named after your dependency (so an Alamofire license file should be called `Alamofire.license`)

### 2.  Create a settings bundle in your project

You'll see the acknowledgements in your app's settings scene, so create a settings bundle & ensure it is included in your target.

### 3.  Add Plugin

```bash
fastlane add_plugin acknowledgements
```

### 4.  Use the plugin in the Fastfile

```ruby
acknowledgements(
  settings_bundle: 'path/to/settings.bundle',
  license_path: 'path/to/licenses'
)
```

You can also specify a different extension for your licenses using the optional `license_extension` parameter:

```ruby
license_extension: '.acknowledgement'
```

## Run tests for this plugin

To run both the tests & code style validation, run

```
rake
```

To automatically fix many of the styling issues, use
```
rubocop -a
```
